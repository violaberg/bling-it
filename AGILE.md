# **Agile Methodology**

## **Overview**

This project was created using Agile Methodology to split it in smaller tasks. To do so, I created user stories with acceptance criteria and grouped these into EPIC milestones so I can focus on one feature at the time.

### **EPIC**

In Agile tasks/user stories can be broken down into EPICS or Milestones. It's a helpful way to segment user stories based on needs/requests of end-users while working towards a fully functional project.<br>

I edited due dates few times as I learned in proccess how long time certain tasks take or for example, made different design choices, as sometimes when all is added together, changes are needed.

#### **EPIC 1**

I struggled with starting to create database schema as I'm still slightly confused about it but once started, it went surprisingly fast and wasn't as ard as I remember from project 4. Wireframes was one of the first things I did during planning phase, while some changes might occur during development, they show great base for this project.

### **USER STORIES**

A user story serves as an explanation how a certain feature will provide a value to a user. The help developer to understand what and why they are building to provide a better end product overall. Boutique Ado walkthrough user stories were used for part of this project and some adjusted to suit it better, with more user stories added by myself.

[All user stories can be found following this link to my Github repository](https://github.com/violaberg/bling-it/issues)

### **MoSCoW METHOD**

A MoSCoW Method is a popular prioritization technique used in many projects, not only software development. It uses a 4-step approach of "must-have", "should-have", "could-have" and "won't-have".

### **GITHUB KANBAN BOARD**

Kanban board is one way how to provide a visual for project management, optimize workflow and increase efficiency. As it is my first time fully implementing Kanban board, ups and downs and some inaccuracy was expected.

## **Conclusion**

 As my experience grows using Agile, I found it much easier and less messy using it this time around.<br>
 Overall it was a great experience and kept me on track most of the time, as well as helped to understand how much is left to do as at times project felt never ending.<br>
 During this project I participated in hackathon and it was my first time being a SCRUM master which lead to even better understanding of Kanban board and how it works in real-life team work. I consider this experience very valuable and feel it helped me continue you with my own project.
